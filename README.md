# Horieson Code Refractor Project
For the project, I had to fix the link for the Search Engine Optimization by making it a tag as well as a class in HTML, I added "alt" elements to each image and icon, I gave the webpage a title and favicon, and furthmore, I consolidated the content and benefits blocks (what I could of them anyway, as some of it did have to be unique) in CSS, eliminating their redundancy. I also left notes for just about every CSS function, detailing what they should be doing. Additionally, I changed the header property of the footnote in both CSS and HTML to h4.
